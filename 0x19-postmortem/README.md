Server failure report

On February 22, 2023, from 9:00 PM to 11:30 PM EST, our hospital management system website experienced an outage that affected 37% of our users. During the outage, users were unable to access the website, browse appointments, patients were not able to access their medical information and the inventory manager couldnâ€™t manage shortages since the website was off to report the shortage. The root cause of the issue was a database failure that caused the website to become unresponsive.

Timeline

9:00 PM: The issue was detected when our monitoring system alerted us of increased error rates and server latency.
9:05 PM: Our engineering team began investigating the issue, assuming it was a server overload due to increased traffic.
9:20 PM: After ruling out server overload, the team suspected a database issue and began investigating the database servers.
9:40 PM: The team identified a hardware failure on one of the database servers and attempted to failover to a backup server.
10:00 PM: The failover attempt was unsuccessful, and the team escalated the incident to the database administration team.
10:30 PM: The database administration team diagnosed the issue as a corrupt database file and began restoring from a backup.
11:00 PM: The database was successfully restored, and the website began to recover.
11:30 PM: The website was fully restored, and all users were able to access the website and complete tasks.

Root Cause and Resolution

The root cause of the issue was a corrupt database file that caused the primary database server to become unresponsive. The database administration team identified and resolved the issue by restoring from a backup.

Corrective and Preventative Measures

To prevent similar issues in the future, we will be implementing the following measures:

Improve database monitoring to detect and alert us of potential issues before they become critical.
Implement a more robust backup and disaster recovery plan to ensure minimal downtime in the event of a database failure.
Perform regular database maintenance to prevent corruption and optimize performance.
Improve communication and escalation processes to ensure a more efficient incident response.
